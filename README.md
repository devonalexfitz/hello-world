# hello-world
let's do this!
I am looking to become a dynamic software developer, especially as IoT and quantum computing makes headway in society and becomes ubiquitous. Although I have limited experience, I am now changing that! Coding is becoming such a valuable skill I have decided to approach it with a consistent tenacity in order to learn it as well as I can. Hopefully this is the start of a new career!
